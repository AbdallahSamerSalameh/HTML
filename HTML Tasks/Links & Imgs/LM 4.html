        Fish are aquatic, cold-blooded vertebrates with gills, fins, and scales. They are the largest group of vertebrates, with over 33,000 species. Fish are found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams to the deep ocean, and from the tropics to the Arctic Circle. They are an important food source for humans and play a vital role in the world's ecosystems.
